# Artfinder - a browser for discovering Japanese artists

This is a faceted browser for searching through Japanese artists. Select tags from one of the multiple facets on the left (multiple tags can be chosen at once and are displayed on the right). A list of artists filtered by those tags appear in the centre. Artists can also be filtered by plain text search using the search text box.
